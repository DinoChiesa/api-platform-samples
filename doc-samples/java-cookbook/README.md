# Java callout sample

This sample is a simple proxy that uses a Java Callout policy. The Java callout
converts the API proxy response content and headers to uppercase. This sample is
designed to be used with the Apigee Edge doc topic [Convert the response to
uppercase with a Java
callout](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/cookbook/use-java-customize-api). Please
refer to that topic to about building and deploying this sample.

It also works with Apigee X and hybrid.

>Note: This example `pom.xml` and related build files are intended as examples
>only. When you create your own Java callout, you may need to add dependencies
>or make other modifications that are beyond the scope of this example.
